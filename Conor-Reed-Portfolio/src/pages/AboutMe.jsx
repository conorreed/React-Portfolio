                Hey, my name is Conor Reed and I have always had a passion for learning and competition. From a young age I was
                interested in learning about the past and finding ways to relate it to the present. It came as no surprise when I decided to get a bachelors degree in History. 
                While in community college I had dabbled in programming courses where I learned the basics of C++. At the time, this did not seem like the correct path because
                I was not able to see myself using it. Recently, I completed a 3 month fullstack web development bootcamp where I was able to recieve comprehensive training 
                in many different technologies such as html, css, JavaScript, mySQL, MongoDB, React, and others. What began as a path for a stable career ended up sparking a desire to learn more
                while continuing to grow as a web developer.
